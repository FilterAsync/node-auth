# Node.js Authentication Starter

I tried my best to do an authentication this difficult. However it's my first experience of a complex web authentication and it isn't even finished so please let me know if there is any vulnerable/bugs.

## Features
- [x] Login, Logout, Register & session timeout (expiry)
- [x] Email verification + Resend email
