# Node.js Authentication Starter

I tried my best to do an authentication this difficult. However it isn't finished so please let me know if there is any vulnerable/bugs.
Here is an example of a web authentication that uses both MongoDB and Redis.

## Features
- [x] Login, Logout, Register & session timeout (expiry)
