# Node.js Authentication Starter

I tried my best to do an authentication this difficult. However it isn't finished so please let me know if there is any vulnerable/bugs.
Here is an example of a web authentication that uses both MongoDB and Redis.

## Features
[x] Login, Logout, Register & session timeout (expiry)
[x] Email verification + Resend email
[x] Password Reset
[-] Too Many Requests
[-] Persistent Login (Remember Me) (A bit progress)
[-] Login reCaptcha verification trap &nbsp; *(redirects to a verification page if the credentials are incorrect.)*
[-] Facebook/Google/Twitter Passport External Login

## Front-End TODO:
